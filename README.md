As a pet clinic employee I would like to be able to add a new pet to our system.
The pet can have a picture or not, an owner -mandatory - [the owner MUST have a phone
number and an address], the type of pet, his/her name.
The owner can be a previous pet owner that came to our clinic with a different pet.

treatment will have a description, a cost, the date etc.

it’s treatments to be deleted but I do not want the owner’s info to be deleted with it.

I do not want to have two users with the same username.

I do not want to be able to change my username to a username that already exists.

When I retrieve owners I do not want to get all the pets and all their treatments as well - I just
want a list of owners.

I want to be able to GET pets that were treated between two dates. For example - I want a list
of all the pets that were treated in our clinic between 1st of march and 10th of march.

I want to be able to use multiple filters for pets.

We need to encrypt all the passwords and save them encrypted in the db.
If two users have the same password I do not want the same encrypted text to be saved in the db.
